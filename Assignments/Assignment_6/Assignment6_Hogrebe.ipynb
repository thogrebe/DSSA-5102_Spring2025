    "Now we will start the process of uploading our dataset into a database. There are many different ways to upload your .csv data into a database (.db file). Databases can be created in many open source applications, MySQL workbench, and even some websites can load your .csv data into a database...for a small fee. Instead of using an application, we are going to first create our database for our dataset from scratch in Python. On a much larger scale, data may be automatically uploaded to a database once it is aquired.<br>\n",

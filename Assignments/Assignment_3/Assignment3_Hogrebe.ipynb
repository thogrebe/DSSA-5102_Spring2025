    "We introduced in Assignment #2 the imporatance of data cleaning and why accurrate data is needed when making informed decisions in our fields. In our assignment, we were faced with making the decision whether or not to omit data we may not know too much about yet. \n",

    "<b>Metadata</b> is data about the data. Metadata can be structural, administrative, statistical and much more.\n",

    "When building your data warehouses it is important to have data cleaning protocols established for your organization BEFORE you start to clean the data.<br><br>\n",
    "Your task for Assignment #3 is to:<br>\n",
    "-  Enhance your Github account. Add your contact (Stockton) email, your LinkedIn profile, a description, etc.\n",
    "-  Create a Github repository for this class. It can be public or private. If you choose to make it private, add the instructor as a collaborator. @MelissaLaurino<br>\n",
    "-  It is suggested to create your repository using the Git terminal commands. See Blackboard for step by step instructions.\n",
    "-  Staying Connected -> Visit the Discussion Board and share your username with classmates. Follow your classmates on Github.<br>\n",
    "-  Upload Assignment #1, #2, and your clean data (If you created a physical clean copy of it, otherwise the link is fine) to your new/established Github repository. For every repository you create, you'll automatically have the option to include a README.md (Meta data) file. <br>\n",

    "# **Dataset Documentation: Drug Overdose Death Rates by Drug Type, Sex, Age, Race, and Hispanic Origin – United States**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Where is the data from?**\n",
    "The dataset is provided by the **U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS)** and is available on [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/drug-overdose-death-rates-by-drug-type-sex-age-race-and-hispanic-origin-3f72f).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. How was it collected?**\n",
    "The data was collected from **national health records**, including death certificates and medical examiner reports compiled by the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** and the **National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. How was it extracted?**\n",
    "The dataset was extracted from CDC’s mortality surveillance systems, using standard reporting protocols to aggregate state-level and national-level overdose death rates. It was then made available on Data.gov in machine-readable formats such as CSV and JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. What program was used to clean the data?**\n",
    "The dataset was cleaned using **Python (Pandas, NumPy, and Regular Expressions)** in a Jupyter Notebook \n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. How was the data cleaned or transformed?**\n",
    "- **Standardized Column Names:**\n",
    "  - Converted all column names to lowercase.\n",
    "  - Replaced spaces with underscores to make them SQL-friendly.\n",
    "  - Removed special characters to prevent SQL errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Data:**\n",
    "  - Identified missing values across all columns.\n",
    "  - Dropped columns where more than **50% of values were missing**.\n",
    "  - Filled missing numerical values with the **median** of the column.\n",
    "  - Filled missing categorical values with the **mode** (most frequently occurring value).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filtering & Transforming Data:**\n",
    "  - **Removed the \"All ages\" category** from the `age` column to avoid aggregation bias.\n",
    "  - Converted the `year` column to an integer type.\n",
    "  - Ensured numerical columns were stored in numeric format instead of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removing Duplicates & Handling Outliers:**\n",
    "  - Identified and removed duplicate rows.\n",
    "  - Capped extreme values in the `estimate` column at the **99th percentile** to prevent skewing analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Final Steps:**\n",
    "  - Saved the cleaned dataset as `drug_overdose_cleaned.csv` for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. What are the units of the numeric data?**\n",
    "- **Death rates are measured in deaths per 100,000 resident population**.\n",
    "- **Numerical identifiers** (e.g., `panel_num`, `unit_num`) represent categorical classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. What were the formulas used in column creation(s)?**\n",
    "- **Crude rate formula:**\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{Crude Rate} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Number of deaths in a group}}{\\text{Total population of that group}}\\right) \\times 100,000\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "- **Age-adjusted rate formula:**\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\sum_{i} \\left(\\frac{\\text{Age group deaths}_i}{\\text{Age group population}_i}\\right) \\times 100,000 \\times \\text{Weight}_i\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  where `Weight_i` represents the proportion of the population in a given age group.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8. How is the data validated to ensure consistency?**\n",
    "- **Checked for missing values** and handled them based on data type.\n",
    "- **Verified unique values in categorical columns** (e.g., `age`) to ensure correct classifications.\n",
    "- **Checked for duplicate rows** and removed them to avoid double counting.\n",
    "- **Applied outlier detection** by capping extreme values in `estimate`.\n",
